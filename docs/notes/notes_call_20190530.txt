DECISIONS WERE MADE
===================

Queercon call - Thursday May 30th 2019

Key concepts:

 - There is a "cyber world" overlaid on Vegas
 
 - The goal is to create or enable or activate a Queercon in the cyber world.
 
 - The cyber world doesn't have the same geography as the real world, but there
   are points where it corresponds/overlaps. These correspond to important
   places at the con.

 - Your badge is a cyber deck - a specialized hacking tool that can connect 
   you to the cyber world.
   
 - There is a digital currency called Queer Coin, which you earn and spend, and
   is stored on your badge.
   
 - Your badge runs an Agent, a piece of software that you can send to interact
   with the cyber world.
   
 - Agents do missions, which are assigned by Handlers.
 
 - Handlers assign missions automatically, without needing the human Handlers
   to do anything other than be nearby. There are also one or two virtual 
   Handlers that can be accessed at any time.
   
 - Base stations are physical links between the real world and the cyber world;
   they exist in both. The base stations are how the cyber world bleeds into
   queercon, whereas the badges are how queercon reaches into the cyber world.

 - The badge MAY store some images from the cyber world, corresponding to
   events that the badgeholder participated in. This way, you can bring
   queercon home with you.
   
Mechanics:

 - C badges (access passes) are unique, and add capabilities to the Q badges
   when connected.
 
 - At least some capabilities of the C badges are one shot per Q badge.


Questions:

 - Does the cyber world extend to any part of DC proper, or just QC?
 
 - What form do the missions take? How do you equip your agent to run the 
   missions?
   
 - We need a better word than "Base station" for the physical links between
   the worlds.
   
 - What does the agent look like?
 
 - How do you earn queercoin, exactly?
 
 - How do you spend queercoin, exactly? And on what?
